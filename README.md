# ATM Interface (Java)

A simple **console-based ATM Interface** built in Java.  
Users can **Withdraw**, **Deposit**, **Check Balance**, and **Exit**.  
The menu runs in a loop (do–while) and uses a `switch-case` to handle actions.  
Overdraft is prevented with basic input validation.

## ✨ Features
- 🔁 Interactive menu with continuous looping until **Exit**
- 🔀 `switch-case` based action handling
- 💸 Withdraw money (with insufficient balance check)
- ➕ Deposit money
- 🧮 Check balance
- ✅ Friendly console messages and error handling
